# Performance: measured behavior and regression checks

The goal, in ember's words: "We can't be blowing up to GBs of heap. We need to find a way to have
this being hella fast." Stream, never materialize a session or store you do not need whole; never
re-read bytes already seen; use all cores; keep heap bounded by work in flight, not file size;
every index or mark over a file verifies itself on use. The datapath design and open gaps are in
[`DATAPATHS.md`](DATAPATHS.md); the dated logs and per-change evidence files are in git history.

## Regression checks

CI checks the corpus counting pass against a plain read of the same bytes in the same run
(`tests/perf_budget.rs`). This ratio partly controls runner speed; passing it is a regression
check, not evidence of a small speedup or a throughput promise for real sessions.

The generated-input heap gates (`tools/check-heap-budget.py` and
`tools/check-operation-heap.py`) compare requested live Rust allocations across input sizes,
including 16/64 MiB giant fields, native mmap and positioned reads. These checks remain useful
regression detectors; their bounds do not describe native SQLite allocation or whole-process RSS.

This document records measurements rather than latency, throughput, or fleet-size targets.
First-run discovery, unchanged indexing, appends and full recounts need separate measurements:
they do different work, and a result on one fleet is not a promise for another.

## How to measure without lying

- Copy the catalog and index into a scratch `CLUSTERVISION_HOME`; transcripts are read-only. For
  before/after on the real fleet, compare against a frozen APFS clone (`cp -c -R`), deleted after.
- Prefer work counts (instructions, traversed/decoded bytes, allocation requests, peak live heap,
  staged bytes) over wall time on the shared host; when timing, interleave runs and state the load.
  RSS counts file-backed mmap pages; report `footprint` for mmap-heavy harnesses.
- Output must be byte-identical: hash every message in lazy, bulk and full mode before and after,
  run the corpus golden test, and compare `cv show --json` on a sample.

## Measured

Every number below carries its date and conditions; a wall time measured on a loaded host is
reported with the load. The 0.17 release tree (c7aa0c22, 2026-10-16)
was not timed: the host sat at load 100-175 all day, so only load-independent facts about it are
recorded (counts, instructions retired, memory, sizes) under "0.17 facts" below.

**2026-10-14, 0eea676f -> v17-perf.** Release builds, `/usr/bin/time -l`, instructions retired
(repeat to ~1%; the host's load was 25-200, so wall times are wide). Frozen: APFS clone under a
fake HOME, 5,421 sessions (claude 38 GB; codex 40 GB, 3,923 of 4,483 rollouts `.jsonl.zst`,
~89 GB decoded). Live: the real HOME read-only, ~7,000 sessions, scratch `CLUSTERVISION_HOME`.

| operation | 0eea676f | v17-perf |
|---|---|---|
| index, nothing changed, frozen | 7.5-9.0 G insn, 0.74-3.10 s | 4.3-4.5 G, 0.41-0.80 s |
| index, nothing changed, live | 27-36 G, 2.6-5.2 s | 6.7-12.3 G, 0.99-1.61 s |
| index after ~1 MB appended to each of 3 sessions | 9.3 G, 0.95-0.98 s | 5.9-6.1 G, 0.70-0.74 s |
| full recount, catalog deleted, frozen | 21.6 T, 849 s, RSS 2.9 GB | 12.8 T, 834 s, RSS 2.9 GB, footprint 689 MB |
| ls, first run, frozen | 9,546 G, 257 s | 5,178-5,188 G, 158-186 s |
| ls, warm, frozen / live | 0.50 G, 0.06-0.09 s | 0.50 G, 0.06-0.09 s (when no live session changed) |
| `ls -q has:plan`, frozen | 4.9 G, 0.47-1.43 s | 1.7 G, 0.24-0.30 s |
| `show --last 20` | | claude 3.7 G vs 3.6 G; codex 708 MB 12.6 G vs 12.7 G; codex zst 412 MB 28.0 G vs 27.8 G (session counting pass) |
| counting pass | | best of 3: claude 190 MB at 641 MB/s, codex 708 MB at 719 MB/s, codex zst at 174 MB/s decoded |

A live "nothing changed" index also re-reads whatever ember's running sessions appended, so its
range is the live write rate. The compressed path's floor is ruzstd's decode: 18.1-18.6 G for
the 412 MB rollout with ruzstd 0.8.3 or 0.9.1 (C `zstd -dc`: 4.7 G). A cold index decodes each
rollout once since 0.17: discovery hands its decoded bytes to the sweep running beside it.
A full build from an empty home, frozen: 21.6 T, 737 s -> 12.9 T, 866 s, footprint 565 -> 715 MB.
Live: 13.5 T, 966 s, RSS 3.4 GB, footprint 759 MB. `has:` now pays for the Claude tool-results
inventory (a stat per file), which 0.16.1 did not check.

Not reproducible on the 2026-10-14 fleet, so removed: perf-2's recount 41-44 s / 140 MB, unchanged
index 0.03-0.05 s, first listing 7.5-7.8 s, and the 421.5 s live index of 2026-10-13. All
were measured before most codex rollouts were compressed.

**0.17 facts (c7aa0c22, 2026-10-16, release build, live HOME read-only, fresh scratch
`CLUSTERVISION_HOME`, host load 100-175: no wall times).** The fleet is 7,374 top-level sessions
(1,435 Claude transcripts, 4,872 Codex rollouts of which 4,091 `.jsonl.zst`; 39 GB + 42 GB on
disk). Instructions retired, `/usr/bin/time -l`:

| operation | 0.17 | the 2026-10-14 figure |
|---|---|---|
| `ls`, first run on an empty home | 2.36 T; RSS 850 MB, footprint 101 MB | 5.18 T frozen (5,421 sessions) |
| `ls`, warm | 0.61-0.62 G; footprint 16 MB (the first warm read after discovery: 3.4 G) | 0.50 G |
| `ls -q has:plan`, first ever (builds the counts for every session) | 2.81 T; footprint 140 MB | |
| `ls -q has:plan`, after `cv index` | 2.8-3.2 G; footprint 46 MB | 1.7 G frozen |
| `cv index`, first pass on the discovered home | 3.35 T; RSS 3.6 GB, footprint 891 MB | 12.9 T frozen full build |
| `cv index`, second pass | re-read 4,893 of 7,374 sessions, 1.94 T, footprint 538 MB | |
| `cv index`, third pass | 11 changed (live appends), 7,362 unchanged, 17.6 G, footprint 145 MB | 6.7-12.3 G live |
| `show --last 20`, Claude 190 MB | 3.34-3.38 G | 3.7 G |
| `show --last 20`, Codex 708 MB plain | 10.3-11.7 G | 12.6 G |
| `show --last 20`, Codex 227 MB `.jsonl.zst` | 11.3-11.65 G | (412 MB rollout: 28.0 G) |

The index of that home is 2.4 GB of tantivy segments and a 193 MB `catalog.db` (7,374 session
rows, 6,828 scan-cache rows, 1,513,943 events, 7,374 affordance-count rows, 22,120 source
dependencies, 389 watched paths). The second index pass is a defect, not a cost: 4,893 is the
Codex rollout count, so that snapshot's first-pass Codex baselines did not hold. This is historical
evidence; verify the present tree with repeated unchanged passes, including compressed rollouts. The one-time 0.17 upgrade costs on a home built by 0.16.1 (catalog reread
for the new identity, the index rebuild for the `context` field and the title rule, the semantic
re-embed) were **not measured**: the upgrade run was stopped for load. Expect one full reread of
every session by the catalog and one by the indexer, and one re-embed of every session's exchange.

Peak requested Rust heap, before -> after the datapaths pass (2026-10-12..14; not re-measured
here, the CI heap gates that bound them pass; compressed Codex now also gated, 6.4 MB flat):

| operation | before | after |
|---|---:|---:|
| Gemini lazy count, frozen 313.8 MB | 841 MB | 42.7 KB |
| Claude lazy count, generated 100 MB escaped text | 365 MB | 10.9 KB |
| Codex tool-only lazy count, 16 -> 64 MiB payloads | 12.4 -> 49.7 MB | 4.3 KB, flat |
| Continue / LM Studio discovery, 16 -> 64 MiB bodies | 33.6 -> 134.7 MB | 1.2-1.4 KB, flat |
| Claude metadata discovery, 64 MiB of outputs | 49.5-68.4 MB | 96 KB, flat |
| Event extraction + SQL publication, 200,000 events | 58.9 MB | 358 KB, flat |
| Doctor, 64 MiB giant fields (Claude/Codex/Gemini) | 33-67 MB | 4.6-201 KB, flat |
| Portable Claude export, two 67 MB escaped payloads | whole payloads | 1.39 MB native, 1.45 MB no-mmap |

Bounded heap is not free CPU: dense escaped text decodes at 2.1-2.3x the old whole-field CPU,
OpenClaw bounded replay costs about 1.5x CPU, and Zed's decoded spill is about 16% above the
original one-parse reader on escaped input. None of these figures bounds native SQLite allocation
or whole-process RSS.

## Resume marks (2026-10-14)

A resume mark (`resume.rs`) is checked by device and inode, length, and a hash of the first 4 KiB
and the 4 KiB before the mark. An in-place edit outside those samples that is followed by growth
is not detected: index and watch resume past it, and the edited bytes keep the docs, events and
counts they were read with until a whole pass (`cv index --rebuild`, a same-size rewrite, or a new
inode). Rewind's prefix receipt has the same limit, and so does the append admission of a captured
`.jsonl` (`source::FileId::admits`): a stat that changed at the captured length (a writer
mid-`write`) is admitted when the samples match, so a same-length edit outside them is not caught.

Hashing the whole prefix on each resume would close the gap, and was rejected. On the largest
local transcript (189,759,498 bytes), the mark's FNV-1a took 1.03 s and 1.22 s (0.16 to 0.19
GB/s, on a machine shared with builds), and reading the page-cached file took 0.05 s. A resume
otherwise reads only the appended suffix. Watch resumes on every append, and the local Claude
store is 33,168 transcripts holding 36.3 GB. A full check therefore turns every resumed pass back
into a whole read of bytes already seen. Detecting such edits needs a writer or filesystem change
signal, which no harness provides.

## Open measurement gaps

Audited against `git log v0.17.0..HEAD` on 2026-10-21:

- **First listing and full recount remain unmeasured on the current fleet.** Count deferral
  (`08a8dfb8`, `734af650`, `2ab873aa`, `80295ea7`, `a200e811`, `d358ff0e`) changed the work;
  the 0.17 measurements above cannot stand in for a new composed run with compressed Codex.
- **Repeated unchanged indexing needs fleet confirmation.** `6049df0a` removed discovery's
  writer-observation work and `1aec79ae` checks unchanged compressed rollouts. These close that
  regression case, not the historical fleet-wide second-pass measurement. No current fleet
  result establishes that every baseline holds across repeated passes.
- **Upgrade cost is unknown.** The 0.16.1 upgrade gate (`1ff6669c`) checks migrated output against
  a clean index; it does not measure fleet upgrade time, heap or re-embedding cost.
- **Arbitrary prefix-edit detection remains limited** by the samples described above. A full
  hash contradicts the measured suffix-only work goal; no harness supplies a trusted change
  signal. Native SQLite allocation and whole-process RSS likewise remain outside Rust heap gates.
