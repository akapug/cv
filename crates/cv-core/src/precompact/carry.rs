//! What a summary carries verbatim from one generation to the next, never re-summarized: the
//! person's rulings, the open promises, the terms the work uses, the self and setup facts, the
//! live identifiers, and pointers to the standing rules the work touched.
//!
//! Rules come in three layers, and cv re-introduces only the middle one. The base layer
//! (instruction files, memory, skills) is re-injected by the harness after every compaction, so it
//! is never copied. The per-turn layer (rules a hook injects when a turn calls for them) keeps
//! firing after the seam, so it is not duplicated either. What a compaction loses is the
//! contextual layer: the person's rulings in the span, verbatim (a ruling that was never filed
//! anywhere exists only there), and which standing rules the span's work touched, carried as
//! pointers ([`Pointer`]: the rule's id, never its text). The selection is deterministic: a
//! ruling must quote a message the person wrote, outside the harness's markup, and a pointer is an
//! id the configured patterns found in the span; each records why it was chosen.
//!
//! Loss compounds over summary generations: a compactor asked to keep side constraints keeps few
//! of them, while a separate extractor whose output is appended after the summary keeps most
//! (arXiv 2608.11242). So the narrative summary and these sections are two passes: the extraction
//! pass returns quotes, each quote is kept only when it is found verbatim in the message it cites
//! ([`verify`], so an extractor cannot plant a fact the transcript does not hold), and the kept
//! items are merged into the previous generation's ([`Carry::merge`]) instead of being
//! summarized again. Identifiers are read from the span by shape ([`ids`]), with no model, and so
//! are the lines of the span that state a sha, a row or a count ([`lines`]): a blind probe found
//! the narrative thins them (this window's items 2 of 6, native 4), and a line copied whole keeps
//! the number with what it counts.
//!
//! A session that moves to cv from its harness's own compaction brings a summary cv never wrote,
//! with nothing of it in any carry: rulings, schedules, handles and balances the harness kept,
//! which the narrative is told not to list and a ruling may not quote. So the extraction also
//! copies out the lines of that summary that still bind ([`Section::Standing`]), verified against
//! it, bounded in bytes ([`Limits::standing_bytes`]), and marked as of that summary.
//!
//! The carry is bounded. A pointer is made only from what the agent itself did with a rule (named
//! it in a reply or a tool call, or drew a refusal naming it), never from a rule a hook merely
//! injected, and only the most recently used are kept ([`Limits::pointers`]). An item no span
//! has said or used again for [`Limits::retire_after`] windows retires; a ruling of the person's
//! never retires by age, only when a later ruling of theirs supersedes it. Every `[m:ID]` the
//! narrative cites must be a message of the window, written in full ([`cites`]).
