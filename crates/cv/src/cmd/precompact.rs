//! `cv watch --kind precompact`: write a live session's compaction summary before its harness
//! asks for it, keep it current as the session grows, and hand it to the harness inside the
//! harness's own compaction. A `cv watch` consumer, not a verb of its own (the 0.19 design record,
//! D4).
//!
//! The core (record, key, commitments, the commit check, profiles, prompts) is
//! `cv_core::precompact`; this module is the thin driver around it: the resident follower
//! (`cv watch --kind precompact`: prepare under a lease, publish ready records), and its actions:
//! one-shot writes (`now`), the commit a harness plugin calls inside its compaction (`commit`),
//! the record of every compaction that plugin saw, cv's or the harness's own (`observe`), the
//! replay check (`check`), the explicit new-session fallback (`swap`), and the measurements
//! (`report`). No proxy sits in the path. Design: `docs/design/PRECOMPACT.md`.
